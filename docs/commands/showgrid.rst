The ``showgrid`` command returns a table with data for the specified
*STASTICTYPE* parameter. The left-most column shows the maximum number
of nodes required by the jobs shown in the other columns. The column
heads indicate the maximum wall clock time (in HH:MM:SS notation)
requested by the jobs shown in the columns. The data returned in the
table varies by the *STATISTICTYPE* requested. For table entries with
one number, it is of the data requested. For table entries with two
numbers, the left number is the data requested and the right number is
the number of jobs used to calculate the average. Table entries that
contain only dashes (-------) indicate no job has completed that matches
the profile associated for this inquiry. The bottom row shows the totals
for each column. Following each table is a summary, which varies by the
*STATISTICTYPE* requested.

This particular example shows the average expansion factor grid. Each
table entry indicates two pieces of information -- the average expansion
factor for all jobs that meet this slot's profile and the number of jobs
that were used to calculate this average. For example, the XFactors of
two jobs were averaged to obtain an average XFactor of 1.24 for jobs
requiring over 2 hours 8 minutes, but not more than 4 hours 16 minutes
and between 5 and 8 nodes. Totals along the bottom provide overall
XFactor averages weighted by job, node, and node-seconds.
