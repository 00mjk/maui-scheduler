The Maui Scheduler is a *policy engine* which allows sites control over
when, where, and how resources such as processors, memory, and disk are
allocated to jobs. In addition to this control, it also provides
mechanisms which help to intelligently optimize the use of these
resources, monitor system performance, help diagnose problems, and
generally manage the system.
