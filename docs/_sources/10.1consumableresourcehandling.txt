Consumable Resource Handling
############################

Maui is designed to inherently handle consumable resources. Nodes
possess resources, and workload (jobs) consume resources. Maui tracks
any number of consumable resources on a per node and per jobs basis.
Work is under way to allow 'floating' per system resources to be handled
as well. When a job is started on a set of nodes, Maui tracks how much
of each available resource must be dedicated to the tasks of the job.
This allows Maui to prevent per node oversubscription of any resource,
be it CPU, memory, swap, local disk, etc.

Recent enhancements to Loadleveler (version 2.2 and above) finally
provide a resource manager capable of exercising this long latent
capability. These changes allow a user to specify per task consumable
resources and per node available resources. For example, a job may be
submitted requiring 20 tasks, with 2 CPUs and 256 MB per task. Thus,
Maui would allow a node with 1 GB of Memory and 16 processors to allow
run 4 of these tasks because 4 tasks would consume all of the available
memory. Consumable resources allow more intelligent allocation of
resources allowing better management of shared node resources.

No steps are required to enable this capability, simply configure the
underlying resource manager to support it and Maui will pick up this
configuration.
