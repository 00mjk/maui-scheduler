The goal of a scheduler in the broadest sense is to make users,
administrators, and managers happy. Users desire the ability to specify
resources, obtain quick turnaround on their jobs, and receive reliable
allocation of resources. Administrators desire happy managers and happy
users. They also desire the ability to understand both the workload and
the resources available. This includes current state, problems, and
statistics as well as information about what is happening *under the covers*.
They need an extensive set of *buttons* and *knobs* to both enable management
enforced policies and tune the system to obtain desired statistics.
