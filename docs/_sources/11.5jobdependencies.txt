Job Dependencies
################

Basic Job Dependency Support
****************************

By default, basic single step job dependencies are supported through
completed/failed step evaluation. Basic dependency support does not
require special configuration and is activated by default. Dependent
jobs are only supported through a resource manager and therefore
submission methods depend upon the specific resource manager being used.

Task Scheduling of DAG's
************************

Moab 4.0 and higher supports task scheduling.
