Application Scheduling Library Overview
***************************************

Moab 4.0 and higher support an application scheduling library which
allows locally developed applications to directly utilize scheduler
information and finctionality. This allows the scheduler to be more
aware of its environment and more capable of utilizing this information
to improve both productivity and fault tolerance.
