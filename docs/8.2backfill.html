<h2>8.2.1. Backfill Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#backfill-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Backfill is a scheduling optimization which allows a scheduler to make
better use of available resources by running jobs out of order. When
Maui schedules, it prioritizes the jobs in the queue according to a
number of factors and then orders the jobs into a &#8216;highest priority
first&#8217; sorted list. It starts the jobs one by one stepping through the
priority list until it reaches a job which it cannot start. Because all
jobs and reservations possess a start time and a wallclock limit, Maui
can determine the completion time of all jobs in the queue.
Consequently, Maui can also determine the earliest the needed resources
will become available for the highest priority job to start.</p>
<p>Backfill operates based on this &#8216;earliest job start&#8217; information.
Because Maui knows the earliest the highest priority job can start, and
which resources it will need at that time, it can also determine which
jobs can be started without delaying this job. Enabling backfill allows
the scheduler to start other, lower-priority jobs so long as they do not
delay the highest priority job. If Backfill is enabled, Maui, &#8216;protects&#8217;
the highest priority job&#8217;s start time by creating a job reservation to
reserve the needed resources at the appropriate time. Maui then can any
job which not not interfere with this reservation.</p>
<p>Backfill offers significant scheduler performance improvement. In a
typical large system, enabling backfill will increase system utilization
by around 20% and improve turnaround time by an even greater amount.
Because of the way it works, essentially filling in holes in node space,
backfill tends to favor smaller and shorter running jobs more than
larger and longer running ones. It is common to see over 90% of these
small and short jobs backfilled. Consequently, sites will see marked
improvement in the level of service delivered to the small, short jobs
and only moderate to no improvement for the larger, long ones.</p>
<p>The question arises, is backfill a purely good feature. Doesn&#8217;t there
have to be a trade-off some where? Doesn&#8217;t there have to be a dark side?
Well, there are a few drawbacks to using backfill but they are fairly
minor. First of all, because backfill locates jobs to run scattered
throughout the idle job queue, it tends to diminish the influence of the
job prioritization a site has chosen and thus may negate any desired
workload steering attempts through this prioritization. Secondly,
although the start time of the highest priority job is protected by a
reservation, what is to prevent the third priority job from starting
early and possibly delaying the start of the second priority job? Ahh, a
problem. Actually, one that is easily handled as will be described
later.</p>
<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a>** The third problem is actually a little more subtle. Consider the
following scenario involving the 2 processor cluster shown in figure 1.
Job A has a 4 hour wallclock limit and requires 1 processor. It started
1 hour ago and will reach its wallclock limit in 3 more hours. Job B is
the highest priority idle job and requires 2 processors for 1 hour. Job
C is the next highest priority job and requires 1 processor for 2 hours.
Maui examines the jobs and correctly determines that job A must finish
in 2 hours and thus, the earliest job B can start is in 2 hours. Maui
also determines that job C can start and finish in less than this amount
of time. Consequently, Maui starts job C on the idle processor. One hour
later, job A completes early. Apparently, the user overestimated the
amount of time his job would need by a few hours. Since job B is now the
highest priority job, it should be able to run. However, job C, a lower
priority job was started an hour ago and the resources needed for job B
are not available. Maui re-evaluates job B&#8217;s reservation and determines
that it can be slid forward an hour. At time 3, job B starts.</p>
<p><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">**</span></a>** Ok, now the post-game show. Job A is happy because it ran to
completion. Job C is happy because it got to start immediately. Job B is
sort of happy because it got to run 1 hour sooner than it originally was
told it could. However, if backfill was not enabled, job B would have
been able to run 2 hours earlier. Not a big deal, usually. However, the
scenario described above actually occurs fairly frequently. This is
because the user estimates for how long their jobs will take is
generally very bad. Job wallclock estimate accuracy, or wallclock
accuracy, is defined as the ratio of wall time required to actually run
the job divided by the wall time requested for the job. Wallclock
accuracy varies from site to site but the site average is rarely better
than 40%. Because the quality of the walltime estimate provided by the
user is so low, job reservations for high priority jobs are often later
than they need to be.</p>
<p>Although there do exist some minor drawbacks with backfill, its net
performance impact on a site&#8217;s workload is very positive. Although a few
of the highest priority jobs may get temporarily delayed, they probably
got to their position as highest priority as soon as they did because
jobs in front of them got to run earlier due to backfill. Studies have
shown that only a very small fraction of jobs are truly delayed and when
they are, it is only by a fraction of their total queue time. At the
same time, many jobs are started significantly earlier than would have
occurred without backfill.</p>

<div class="section" id="backfill-algorithm">
<h2>8.2.2. Backfill Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#backfill-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The algorithm behind Maui backfill scheduling is mostly straightforward
although there are a number of issues and parameters of which you should
be aware. First of all, Maui makes two backfill scheduling passes. For
each pass, Maui selects a list of jobs which are eligible for backfill.
On the first pass, only those jobs which meet the constraints of the
&#8216;soft&#8217; fairness throttling policies are considered and scheduled. The
second pass expands this list of jobs to include those which meet the
&#8216;hard&#8217; (less constrained) fairness throttling policies.</p>
<p>The second important concept regarding Maui backfill is the concept of
backfill windows. The figure below shows a simple batch environment
containing two running jobs and a reservation for a third job. The
present time is represented by the leftmost end of the box with the
future moving to the right. The light grey boxes represent currently
idle nodes which are eligible for backfill. For this example, lets
assume that the space represented covers 8 nodes and a 2 hour timeframe.
To determine backfill windows, Maui analyzes the idle nodes essentially
looking for &#8216;largest node-time rectangles&#8217;. It determines that there are
two backfill windows. The first window, Window 1, consists of 4 nodes
which are available for only one hour (because some of the nodes are
blocked by the reservation for job C). The second window contains only
one node but has no time limit because this node is not blocked by the
reservation for job C. It is important to note that these backfill
windows overlap.<a class="reference internal" href="bfwindows.png"><img alt="Backfill Windows" src="bfwindows.png" style="width: 383px; height: 502px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">**</span></a>** Once the backfill windows have been determined, Maui begins to
traverse them. The current behavior is to traverse these windows &#8216;widest
window first&#8217; (i.e., most nodes to fewest nodes) As each backfill window
is evaluated, Maui applies the backfill algorithm specified by the
<a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#backfillpolicy">BACKFILLPOLICY</a> parameter, be it
<strong>FIRSTFIT</strong>, <strong>BESTFIT</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>Assuming the <strong>BESTFIT</strong> algorithm is applied, the following steps are
taken.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1) The list of feasible backfill jobs is filtered, selecting only
those which will actually fit in the current backfill window.</div>
<div class="line">2) The &#8216;degree of fit&#8217; of each job is determined based on the
<a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#schedulingcriteria">SCHEDULINGCRITERIA</a>
parameter (ie, processors, seconds, processor-seconds, etc)</div>
<div class="line">(ie, if processors is selected, the job which requests the most
processors will have the best fit)</div>
<div class="line">3) The job with the best fit is started.</div>
<div class="line">4) While backfill jobs and idle resources remain, repeat step 1.</div>
</div>
<p>Other backfill policies behave in a generally similar manner. The
parameters documentation can provide further details.</p>
<p>One final important note. By default, Maui reserves only the highest
priority job resulting in a very &#8216;liberal&#8217; and aggressive backfill. This
reservation guarantees that backfilled jobs will not delay the highest
priority job, although they may delay the second highest priority job!
(Actually, due to wallclock inaccuracies, it is possible the the highest
priority job may actually get slightly delayed as well but we won&#8217;t go
into that!) The parameter
<a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#reservationdepth">RESERVATIONDEPTH</a> controls how
conservative/liberal the backfill policy is. This parameter controls how
deep down the priority queue to make reservations. While increasing this
parameter will improve guarantees that priority jobs will not be
bypassed, it reduces the freedom of the scheduler to backfill resulting
in somewhat lower system utilization. The value of the trade-offs often
need to be determined on a site by site basis.</p>

<h3>8.2.3.1. Backfill Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#backfill-policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Backfill is enabled in Maui by specifying the
<a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#backfillpolicy">BACKFILLPOLICY</a> parameter. By
default, backfill is enabled in Maui using the <strong>FIRSTFIT</strong> algorithm.
However, this parameter can also be set to <strong>BESTFIT</strong>, <strong>GREEDY</strong>, or
<strong>NONE</strong> (disabled).

<p>The number of reservations which <em>protect</em> the resources required by
priority jobs can be controlled using

depth can be distributed across job QOS levels using

</div></blockquote>
<p>In a batch environment saturated with serial jobs, serial jobs will,
over time, dominate the resources available for backfill at the expense
of other jobs. This is due to the <em>time-dimension fragmentation</em>
associated with running serial jobs. For example, given an environment
with an abundance of serial jobs, if a multi-processor job completes
freeing processors, one of three things will happen.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The freed resources are allocated to another job requiring the same
number of processors</li>
<li>Additional jobs may complete at the same time allowing a larger job
to allocate the aggregate resources</li>
<li>The freed resources are allocated to one or more smaller jobs</li>
</ol>
<p>In environments where the scheduling iteration is much higher than the
average time between completing jobs, case 3 occurs far more often than
case 2 leading to smaller and smaller jobs populating the system over
time.
To address this issue, the scheduler incorporates the concept of
backfill <em>chunking</em>. Chunking allows the scheduler to favor case 2
maintaining a more controlled balance between large and small jobs. The
idea of chunking involves establishing a time-based threshold during
which resources available for backfill will be aggregated. This
threshold is set using the parameter
<a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#bfchunkduration">BFCHUNKDURATION</a>. When resources
are freed, they are made available only to jobs of a certain size (set
using the parameter <a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#bfchunksize">BFCHUNKSIZE</a>) or
larger. These resources remain <em>protected</em> from smaller jobs until
either additional resources are freed up and a larger job can use the
aggregate resources, or until the <strong>BFCHUNKDURATION</strong> threshold time is
expired. <strong>NOTE</strong>: backfill chunking is only <em>activated</em> when a job of
size <strong>BFCHUNKSIZE</strong> or larger is blocked in backfill due to lack of
resources.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the optimal settings for these parameters
is very site specific and will depend on the workload, (including the
average job turnaround time, job size, and mix of large to small jobs)
cluster resources, and other scheduling environmental factors. Setting
values which are too restrictive will needlessly reduce utilization
while settings which are too relaxed will not allow the desired
aggregation to occur. CAVEAT EMPTOR. (<strong>NOTE</strong>: backfill chunking is
only enabled in conjunction with the <strong>FIRSTFIT</strong> backfill policy.)</p>
