Maui Installation
#################

-  Building Maui
-  Installing Maui (Optional)

   When you are ready to use Maui in production, you may install it into
   the install directory you have configured using **make install**

   | make install

.. note::

   Until the *install* step is performed, all Maui
   executables will be placed in **$MAUIHOMEDIR/bin**. (i.e.,
   maui-3.2.6/bin in the above example)

.. note::

   Maui 3.2 contains a number of static parameter settings
   which may may need adjustment for *extreme* installations. If the
   target cluster may fit in this category, see Appendix D, `Adjusting
   Default Limits <a.ddevelopment.html>`__ and make any needed changes
   prior to issuing the **make** command.
