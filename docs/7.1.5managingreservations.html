<h1>7.1.5. Configuring and Managing Reservations<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-and-managing-reservations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>All reservations, whether they be administrative or standing, possess
many similar traits.
<a class="reference internal" href="images/logo1.gif"><img alt="image4" src="images/logo1.gif" style="height: 24px;" /></a> The <a class="reference external" href="../mcm/index.html">Moab Cluster Manager</a><sup>TM</sup>
provides a graphical interface to <a class="reference external" href="../mcm/reservationMgmt.html">view and control
reservations</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="reservation-attributes">
<h2>7.1.5.1. Reservation Attributes<a class="headerlink" href="#reservation-attributes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All reservations possess a timeframe of activity, an access control
list, and a list of resources to be reserved. Additionally, reservations
may also possess a number of extension attributes including
epilog/prolog specification, reservation ownership and accountability
attributes, and special flags which modify the behavior of the
reservation.</p>
<div class="section" id="start-end-time">
<h3>7.1.5.1.1. Start/End Time<a class="headerlink" href="#start-end-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All reservations possess a start and an end time which define the
reservation&#8217;s <em>active</em> time. During this active time, the resources
within the reservation may only be used as specified by the reservation
ACL. This active time may be specified as either a start/end pair or a
start/duration pair. Reservations exist and are visible from the time
they are created until the active time ends at which point they are
automatically removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-control-list-acl">
<h3>7.1.5.1.2. Access Control List (ACL)<a class="headerlink" href="#access-control-list-acl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For a reservation to be useful, it must be able to limit who or what can
access the resources it has reserved. This is handled by way of an
access control list, or ACL.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resources">
<h3>7.1.5.1.3. Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When specifying which resources to reserve, the administrator has a
number of options. These options allow control over how many resources
are reserved and where they are reserved at. The following reservation
attributes allow the administrator to define resources</p>
<div class="section" id="task-description">
<h4>7.1.5.1.3.1. Task Description<a class="headerlink" href="#task-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A key concept of reservations is the idea of a task. The scheduler uses
the task concept extensively for its job and reservation management. A
task is simply an atomic collection of resources, such as processors,
memory, or local disk, which must be found on the same node. For
example, if a task requires 4 processors and 2 GB of memory, the
scheduler must find all processors AND memory on the same node; it
cannot allocate 3 processors and 1 GB on one node and 1 processor and 1
GB of memory on another node to satisfy this task. Tasks constrain how
the scheduler must collect resources for use in a standing reservation,
however, they do not constrain the way in which the scheduler makes
these cumulative resources available to jobs. A job can use the
resources covered by an accessible reservation in whatever way it needs.
If reservation X allocated 6 tasks with 2 processors and 512 MB of
memory each, it could support job Y which requires 10 tasks of 1
processor and 128 MB of memory or job Z which requires 2 tasks of 4
processors and 1 GB of memory each. The task constraints used to acquire
a reservation&#8217;s resources are completely transparent to a job requesting
use of these resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="taskcount">
<h4>7.1.5.1.3.2. Taskcount<a class="headerlink" href="#taskcount" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Using the task description, the taskcount attribute defines how many
tasks must be allocated to satisfy the reservation request. To create a
reservation, a taskcount and/or a hostlist must be specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hostlist">
<h4>7.1.5.1.3.3. Hostlist<a class="headerlink" href="#hostlist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A hostlist constrains the set of resource which are available to a
reservation. If no taskcount is specified, the reservation will attempt
to reserve one task on each of the listed resources. If a taskcount is
specified which requests fewer resources than listed in the hostlist,
the scheduler will reserve only the number of tasks from the hostlist
specified by the taskcount attribute. If a taskcount is specified which
requests more resources than listed in the hostlist, the scheduler will
reserve the hostlist nodes first and then seek additional resources
outside of this list.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flags">
<h3>7.1.5.1.4. Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Reservation flags allow specification of special reservation attributes
or behaviors. The following flags are supported:
<strong>Flag Name</strong>
<strong>Description</strong>
<strong>BESTEFFORT</strong>
N/A
<strong>BYNAME</strong>
reservation will only allow access to jobs which meet reservation ACL&#8217;s
<em>and</em> <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a>** explicitly request the resources of this reservation using
the job <strong>ADVRES</strong> flag
<strong>OWNERPREEMPT</strong>
job&#8217;s by the reservation owner are allowed to preempt non-owner jobs
using reservation resources
<strong>PREEMPTEE</strong>
N/A
<strong>SPACEFLEX</strong>
reservation is allowed to move from host to host over time in an attempt
to optimize resource utilization*</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Reservations must now explicitly request the ability to &#8216;float&#8217; for optimization purposes by using the <strong>SPACEFLEX</strong>
flag. Previous versions enabled the &#8216;float&#8217; behavior by default if a hostlist was not specified.</p>

<div class="section" id="configuring-standing-reservations">
<h3>7.1.5.1.5. Configuring Standing Reservations<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-standing-reservations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Standing reservations allow resources to be dedicated for particular
uses. This dedication can be configured to be permanent or periodic,
recurring at a regular time of day and/or time of week. There is
extensive applicability of standing reservations for everything from
daily dedicated job runs to improved use of resources on weekends. All
standing reservation attributes are specified via the
<a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#SRCFG">SRCFG</a> parameter using the attributes
listed in the table below.</p>

<strong>AND</strong> or <strong>OR</strong>
<strong>OR</strong>
specifies how TIMELIMIT access status will be combined with other
standing reservation access methods to determine job access. If
TIMELOGIC is set to OR, a job is granted access to the reserved
resources if it meets the TIMELIMIT criteria or any other access
criteria (i.e., USERLIST) If TIMELOGIC is set to AND, a job is granted
access to the reserved resources only if it meets the TIMELIMIT criteria
and at least one other access criteria (NOTE: <strong>TIMELOGIC</strong> is not
supported in Maui 3.2.6 and later. Instead, the <em>required</em> ACL marker,

<p>A standing reservation is similar to a normal administrative reservation
in that it also places an access control list on a specified set of
resources. Resources are specified on a <em>per-task</em> basis and currently
include processors, local disk, real memory, and swap. The access
control list supported for standing reservations includes users, groups,
accounts, job classes, and QOS levels. Standing reservations can be
configured to be permanent or periodic on a daily or weekly basis and
can accept a daily or weekly start and end time. Regardless of whether a
standing reservation is permanent or recurs on a daily or weekly basis,
they are enforced using a series of reservations, extending a number of
<em>periods</em> into the future as controlled by the <strong>DEPTH</strong> attribute of
the <a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#SRCFG">SRCFG</a> parameter.
The examples below demonstrate possibles configuration specified with
the <strong>SRCFG</strong> parameter.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="images/note.gif"><img alt="image6" src="images/note.gif" style="width: 20px; height: 24px;" /></a>when using the <strong>SRCFG</strong> parameter, attribute lists must be
delimited using the <em>comma</em>, <em>pipe</em>, or <em>colon</em> characters (i.e., &#8216;,&#8217;,
&#8216;|&#8217;, or &#8216;:&#8217;), they cannot be space delimited. For example, to specify a
multi-class ACL, specify &#8216;<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SRCFG[test]</span> <span class="pre">CLASSLIST=classA,classB</span></code>&#8216;.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference internal" href="images/note.gif"><img alt="image7" src="images/note.gif" style="width: 20px; height: 24px;" /></a>only one <strong>STARTTIME</strong> and one <strong>ENDTIME</strong> value can be
specified per reservation. If varied start and end times are desired
throughout the week, complementary standing reservations should be
created. For example, to establish a reservation from 8:00 PM until
6:00 AM the next day during business days, two reservations should be
created, one from 8:00 PM until midnight, and the other from midnight
until 6:00 AM. Jobs can run across reservation boundaries allowing
these two reservations function a single reservation which spans the
night.</div>
</div>
<p>The above example fully specifies a reservation including the quantity
of resources requested using the <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> and <strong>RESOURCES</strong>
attributes. In all cases, resources are allocated to a reservation in
units called <em>tasks</em> where a task is a collection of resources which
must be allocated together on a single node. The <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> attribute
specifies the number of these tasks which should be reserved by the
reservation. In conjunction with this attribute, the <strong>RESOURCES</strong>
attribute defines the reservation task by indicating what resources must
be included in each task. In this case, the scheduler must locate and
reserve 1 processor and 512 MB of memory together on the same node for
each task requested.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, a standing reservation reserves resources over
a given timeframe. The <strong>PERIOD</strong> attribute may be set to a value of
<strong>DAY</strong>, <strong>WEEK</strong>, or <strong>INFINITE</strong> to indicate the period over which
this reservation should recur. If not specified, a standing reservation
recurs on a daily basis. If a standing reservation is configured to
recur daily, the attribute <strong>DAYS</strong> may be specified to indicate which
days of the week the reservation should exist. This attribute takes a
comma-delimited list of days where each day is specified as the first
three letters of the day in all capital letters, i.e. <strong>MON</strong> or
<strong>FRI</strong>. The above example specifies that this reservation is periodic
on a daily basis and should only exist on business days.</p>
<p>The time of day during which the requested tasks are to be reserved is
specified using the <strong>STARTTIME</strong> and <strong>ENDTIME</strong> attributes. These
attributes are specified in standard military time HH:MM:SS format and
both <strong>STARTTIME</strong> and <strong>ENDTIME</strong> specification is optional defaulting
to midnight at the beginning and end of the day respectively. In the
above example, resources will be reserved from 9:00 AM until 5:00 PM on
business days.</p>
<p>The final aspect of any reservation is the access control list
indicating who or what can utilize the reserved resources. In the above
example, <strong>CLASSLIST</strong> attribute is used to indicate that jobs
requesting the class <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">interactive</span></code> should be allowed to use this
reservation.</p>

<div class="section" id="specifying-reservation-resources">
<h4>7.1.5.1.5.2. Specifying Reservation Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#specifying-reservation-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In most cases, only a small subset of standing reservation attributes
must be specified in any given case. For example, by default,
<strong>RESOURCES</strong> is set to <strong>``PROCS=-1``</strong> which indicates that each task
should reserve all of the processors on the node on which it is located.
This, in essence, creates a <em>one task equals one node</em> mapping. In many
cases, particularly on uniprocessor systems, this default behavior may
be easiest to work with. However, in SMP environments, the <strong>RESOURCES</strong>
attribute provides a powerful means of specifying an exact,
multi-dimensional resource set.
<a class="reference internal" href="images/note.gif"><img alt="image8" src="images/note.gif" style="width: 20px; height: 24px;" /></a>An examination of the parameters documentation will show that
the default value of <strong>PERIOD</strong> is <strong>DAYS</strong>. Thus, specifying this
parameter in the example above was unnecessary. It was used only to
introduce this parameter and indicate that other options exist beyond
daily standing reservations.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="example-2-host-constrained-standing-reservation">Example 2: Host Constrained Standing Reservation</p>
<p>Although example 1 did specify a quantity of resources to reserve, it
did not specify where the needed tasks were to be located. If this
information is not specified, The scheduler will attempt to locate the
needed resources anywhere it can find them. The example 1 reservation
will essentially <em>float</em> to hosts where the needed resources can be
found.
If a site wanted to constrain a reservation to a subset of available
resources, this could be accomplished using the <strong>HOSTLIST</strong> attribute.
The <strong>HOSTLIST</strong> attribute is specified as a comma-separated list of
hostnames and constrains the scheduler to only select tasks from the
specified list. This attribute can exactly specify hosts or specify them
using host regular expressions. The example below demonstrates a
possible use of the <strong>HOSTLIST</strong> attribute.</p>

<p>The example is now a bit more complex. Note that the <strong>HOSTLIST</strong>
attribute specifies a non-contiguous list of hosts. Any combination of
hosts may be specified and hosts may be specified in any order. In this
example, the <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> attribute is also specified. These two
attributes both apply constraints on the scheduler with <strong>HOSTLIST</strong>
specifying where the tasks can be located and <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> indicating
how many total tasks may be allocated. In the example above, 6 tasks are
requested but only 4 hosts are specified. To handle this, if adequate
resources are available, the scheduler may attempt to allocate more than
one task per host. For example, assume that each host is a
quad-processor system with 1 GB of memory. In such a case, the scheduler
could allocated up to two tasks per host and even satisfy the
<strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> constraint without using all of the hosts in the hostlist.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="images/note.gif"><img alt="image9" src="images/note.gif" style="width: 20px; height: 24px;" /></a>It is important to note that even if there is a one to one
mapping between the value of <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> and the number of hosts in
<strong>HOSTLIST</strong> this does not necessarily mean that the scheduler will
place one task on each host. If, for example, node001 and node002 were 8
processor SMP hosts with 1 GB of memory, the scheduler could locate up
to 4 tasks on each of these hosts fully satisfying the reservation
taskcount without even partially using the remaining hosts. (The
scheduler will place tasks on hosts according to the policy specified
with the
<a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html#NODEALLOCATIONPOLICY">NODEALLOCATIONPOLICY</a>
parameter.) If the hostlist provides more resources than what is
required by the reservation as specified via <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong>, the
scheduler will simply select the needed resources within the set of
hosts listed.</p>

<p class="rubric" id="example-3-reservation-stacking">Example 3: Reservation Stacking</p>
<p>If <strong>HOSTLIST</strong> is specified but <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> is not, the scheduler

<em>debug</em> to its configuration which reserved resources for use by certain
members of its staff using the configuration below:</p>

<p>The new standing reservation is quite simple. Since <strong>RESOURCES</strong> is not
specified, it will allocate all processors on each host that is
allocated. Since <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> is not specified, it will allocate every
host listed in <strong>HOSTLIST</strong>. Since <strong>PERIOD</strong> is set to <strong>INFINITY</strong>,
the reservation is always in force and there is no need to specify
<strong>STARTTIME</strong>, <strong>ENDTIME</strong>, of <strong>DAYS</strong>.</p>
<p>While the reservation resource and timeframe specification is simple,
the reservation access specification is actually a bit more complicated.
Note that the standing reservation has two access parameters set using
the attributes <strong>USERLIST</strong> and <strong>GROUPLIST</strong>. This configuration
indicates that the reservation can be accessed if any one of the access
lists specified is satisfied by the resource consumer (i.e., the job).
In essence, reservation access is <em>logically OR&#8217;d</em> allowing access if
the requestor meets any of the access constraints specified. In this
example, jobs submitted by either user <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">helpdesk</span></code> or any member of the
groups <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operations</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sysadmin</span></code> can use the reserved resources.</p>
<p>While access is granted to the logical <em>OR</em> of access lists specified
within a standing reservation, access is only granted to the logical
<em>AND</em> of access lists across different standing reservations. A
comparison of the standing reservations <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">interactive</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">debug</span></code> in
the example above will indicate that they both can allocate hosts
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">node001</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">node002</span></code>. If <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">node001</span></code> had both of these
reservations in place simultaneously and a job attempted to access this
host during business hours when standing reservation <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">interactive</span></code> was
active. The job could only use the <em>doubly</em> reserved resources if it
requested the run class <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">interactive</span></code> <em>AND</em> it met the constraints of
reservation <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">debug</span></code> (i.e., was submitted by user <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">helpdesk</span></code> or by a
member of the group <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">operations</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sysadmin</span></code>).</p>
<p>Things may be further complicated by the presence of partially reserved
resources. As a rule, the scheduler will not <em>stack</em> reservations unless
it has to. If adequate resources exist, it can allocate reserved
resources <em>side by side</em> in a single SMP host rather than on top of each
other. In the case of a 16 processor SMP host with two 8 processor
standing reservations. Eight of the processors on this host will be
allocated to the first reservation, and eight to the next. Any
configuration is possible. The 16 processor hosts can also have 4
processors reserved for user <em>John</em>, 10 processors reserved for group
<em>Staff</em>, with the remaining 2 processors available for use by any job.</p>
<p>Stacking reservations is not usually required but some sites choose to
do it to enforce elaborate policies. There is no problem with doing so
so long as you can keep things straight. It really is not too difficult
a concept, just takes a little getting used to. See the <a class="reference external" href="7.1.1resoverview.html">Reservation
Overview</a> section for a more detailed
description of reservation use and constraints.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, by default the scheduler enforces standing
reservations by creating a number of reservations where the number
created is controlled by the <strong>DEPTH</strong> attribute. When the scheduler
starts up, and again each night at midnight, the scheduler updates its
periodic, <em>non-floating</em> standing reservations. By default, <strong>DEPTH</strong> is
set to 2, meaning when the scheduler starts up, it will create two 24
hour reservations covering a total of two days worth of time, (i.e. a
reservation for today and one for tomorrow.) For <em>daily</em> reservations,
at midnight, the reservations will <em>roll</em>, meaning today&#8217;s reservation
will expire and be removed, tomorrow&#8217;s reservation will become today&#8217;s
and the scheduler will create a new reservation for the next day.</p>
<p>With this model, the scheduler continues creating new reservations in
the future as time moves forward. Each day, the needed resources are
always reserved. At first, all appears automatic but the standing
reservation <strong>DEPTH</strong> attribute is in fact an important aspect of
reservation <em>rolling</em> which helps address certain site specific
environmental factors. This attribute remedies a situation which might
occur when a job is submitted and cannot run immediately because the
system is backlogged with jobs. In such a case, available resources may
not exist for several days out and the scheduler must reserve these
future resources for this job. With the default <strong>DEPTH</strong> setting of
two, when midnight arrives, the scheduler attempts to <em>roll</em> its
standing reservations but a problem arises in that the job has now
allocated the resources needed for the standing reservation two days
out. The scheduler cannot reserve the resources for the standing
reservation because they are already claimed by the job. The standing
reservation reserves what it can but because all needed resources are
not available, the resulting reservation is now smaller than it should
be or possibly even empty.</p>
<p>If a standing reservation is smaller than it should be, the scheduler
will attempt to add resources each iteration until it is fully
populated. However, in the case of this job, the job is not going to
release its reserved resources until it completes and the standing
reservation cannot claim them until this time. The <strong>DEPTH</strong> attribute
allows a site to specify how <em>deep</em> into the future a standing
reservation should reserve its resources allowing it to claim the
resources first and prevent this problem. If <em>partial</em> standing
reservation us detected on a system, it may be an indication that the
reservations <strong>DEPTH</strong> attribute should be increased.</p>
<p>In example 3 above, the <strong>PERIOD</strong> attribute is set to <strong>INFINITY</strong>.
With this setting, a single, permanent standing reservation is created
and the issues of resource contention do not exist. While this
eliminates the contention issue, infinite length standing reservations
cannot be made periodic.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="example-4-multiple-acl-types">Example 4: Multiple ACL Types</p>
<p>In most cases, access lists within a reservation are logically OR&#8217;d
together to determine reservation access. However, exceptions to this
rule can be specified by using the <em>required</em> ACL marker, &#8216;<strong>*</strong>&#8216;
(i.e., the asterisk). Any ACL marked with this symbol is required and a
job is only allowed to utilized a reservation if it meets <em>all</em> required
ACL&#8217;s and <em>at least one</em> non-required ACL (if specified). A common use
for this facility is in conjunction with the <strong>TIMELIMIT</strong> attribute.
This attribute controls the length of time a job may use the resources
within a standing reservation. This access mechanism can be AND&#8217;d or
OR&#8217;d to the cumulative set of all other access lists as specified by the
required ACL marker. (NOTE: The required ACL marker is only enabled in
Maui 3.2.6 and higher). Consider the following example configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>-----
# maui.cfg

SRCFG[special] TASKCOUNT=32
SRCFG[special] PERIOD=WEEK
SRCFG[special] STARTTIME=1:08:00:00
SRCFG[special] ENDTIME=5:17:00:00
SRCFG[special] NODEFEATURES=largememory
SRCFG[special] TIMELIMIT=1:00:00*
SRCFG[special] QOSLIST=high low special-
SRCFG[special] ACCCOUNTLIST=!projectX,!projectY
-----
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above configuration requests 32 tasks which translate to 32 nodes.
The <strong>PERIOD</strong> attribute makes this reservation periodic on a weekly
basis while the attributes <strong>STARTTIME</strong> and <strong>ENDTIME</strong> specify the
week offsets when this reservation is to start and end. (Note that the
specification format has changed to DD:HH:MM:SS) In this case, the
reservation starts on Monday at 8:00 AM and runs until Friday at 5:00
PM. The reservation is enforced as a series of weekly reservations which
only cover the specified timeframe. The <strong>NODEFEATURES</strong> attribute
indicates that each of the reserved nodes must have the node feature
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">largememory</span></code> configured.</p>
<p>As described above, <strong>TIMELIMIT</strong> indicates that jobs using this
reservation can only use it for one hour. This means the job and the
reservation can only overlap for one hour. Clearly jobs requiring an
hour or less of wallclock time meet this constraint. However, a four
hour job that starts on Monday at 5:00 AM or a 12 hour job which starts
on Friday at 4:00 PM also satisfy this constraint. Also, note the
<strong>TIMELIMIT</strong> required ACL marker, &#8216;<strong>*</strong>&#8216;. It is set indicating that
jobs must not only meet the <strong>TIMELIMIT</strong> access constraint but must
also meet one or more of the other access constraints. In this example,
the job can use this reservation if it can utilize the access specified
via <strong>QOSLIST</strong> or <strong>ACCOUNTLIST</strong>, i.e., it is assigned a QOS of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">high</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">low</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">special</span></code> , or the submitter of the job has an
account which satisfies the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!projectX</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!projectY</span></code> criteria
(More on this below). <strong>NOTE</strong>: See the <a class="reference external" href="7.3qos.html">QOS Overview</a>
for more info about QOS configuration and usage.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="affinity">7.1.5.2.4 Affinity</p>
<p>Reservation ACL&#8217;s allow or deny access to reserved resources but they
may be configured to also impact a job&#8217;s <em>affinity</em> for a particular
reservation. By default, jobs <em>gravitate</em> towards reservations through a
mechanism known known as <em>positive affinity</em>. This mechanism allows jobs
to run on the most constrained resources leaving other, unreserved
resources free for use by other jobs which may not be able to access the
reserved resources. Normally this is a desired behavior. However,
sometimes, it is desirable to reserve resources for use only as a <em>last
resort</em>, i.e., use the reserved resources only when there are no other
resources available. This last resort behavior is known as <em>negative
affinity</em>. Note the &#8216;-&#8216; (hyphen or negative sign) following the
&#8216;<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">special</span></code>&#8216; in the <strong>QOSLIST</strong> values above. This special mark
indicates that QOS &#8216;<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">special</span></code>&#8216; should be granted access to this
reservation but should be assigned negative affinity. Thus, the
<strong>QOSLIST</strong> attribute specifies that QOS <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">high</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">low</span></code> should be
granted access with positive affinity (use the reservation first where
possible) and QOS <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">special</span></code> granted access with negative affinity (use
the reservation only when no other resources are available).</p>
<p>Affinity status is granted on a <em>per access object</em> basis rather than a
<em>per access list</em> basis and always defaults to positive affinity. In
addition to negative affinity, neutral affinity can also be specified
using the &#8216;<strong>=</strong>&#8216; character, i.e.,
&#8216;<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">QOSLIST[0]</span> <span class="pre">normal=</span> <span class="pre">high</span> <span class="pre">debug=</span> <span class="pre">low-</span></code>&#8216;.</p>
<p>In addition to affinity, ACL&#8217;s may also be of different types. Note the
<strong>ACCOUNTLIST</strong> values in the previous example. They are preceded with
an exclamation point, or NOT symbol. This indicates that all jobs with
accounts other than <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectX</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectY</span></code> meet the account ACL.
Note that if a !&lt;X&gt; value (ie &#8216;!projectX&#8217;) appears in an ACL line, that
ACL is satisfied by any object not explicitly listed by a NOT entry.
Also, if an object matches a NOT entry, the associated job is excluded
from the reservation even if it meets other ACL requirements. For
example, a QOS 3 job requesting account &#8216;<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">projectX</span></code> &#8216; will be denied
access to the reservation even though the job QOS matches the QOS
ACL.<strong>Note that the ability to specify &#8216;NOT&#8217; ACLs is only enabled in
Moab 4.0.0 and higher.</strong></p>
<p class="rubric" id="reservation-ownership">7.1.5.2.5 Reservation Ownership</p>
<p>Reservation ownership allows a site to control who <em>owns</em> the reserved
resources during the reservation timeframe. Depending on needs, this
ownership may be identical to, a subset of, or completely distinct from
the reservation ACL. By default, reservation ownership implies resource
accountability and resources not consumed by jobs will be accounted
against the reservation owner. In addition, ownership can also be
associated with special privileges within the reservation.</p>
<p>Ownership is specified using the <strong>OWNER</strong> attribute in the format
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;CREDTYPE&gt;:&lt;CREDID&gt;</span></code>, as in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OWNER=USER:john</span></code>. To enable <em>john&#8217;s</em>
jobs to preempt other jobs using resources within his reservation, the
<strong>SRCFG</strong> attribute <strong>FLAG</strong> should be set to <strong>OWNERPREEMPT</strong>. In the
example below, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">jupiter</span></code> project chooses to share resources with
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">saturn</span></code> project but only when it does not currently need them.</p>

<p class="rubric" id="resource-allocation-behavior">7.1.5.2.5 Resource Allocation Behavior</p>
<p>As mentioned above, standing reservations can operate in one of two
modes, floating, or non-floating (essentially node-locked). A floating
reservation is created when a <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> is specified and
<strong>HOSTLIST</strong> is either not specified or specified with more resources
than are needed to fulfill the <strong>TASKCOUNT</strong> requirement. If a
reservation is non-floating, the scheduler will allocate all resources
specified by the <strong>HOSTLIST</strong> parameter regardless of node state, job
load, or even the presence of other standing reservations. The scheduler
interprets the request for a non-floating reservation as stating, &#8216;I
want a reservation on these exact nodes, no matter what!&#8217;</p>
<p>If a reservation is configured to be floating, the scheduler takes a
more relaxed stand, searching through all possible nodes to find
resources meeting standing reservation constraints. Only Idle, Running,
or Busy node will be considered and further, only considered if no
reservation conflict is detected. The reservation attribute <strong>ACCESS</strong>
can be used to modify this behavior slightly and allow the reservation
to allocate resources even if reservation conflicts exist.</p>
<p>Other standing reservation attributes not covered here include
<strong>PARTITION</strong> and <strong>CHARGEACCOUNT</strong>. These parameters are described in
some detail in the <a class="reference external" href="a.fparameters.html">parameters</a> documentation.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p class="rubric" id="configuring-administrative-reservations">7.1.5.3 Configuring Administrative Reservations</p>
<p>A default reservation, with no ACL, is termed a <em>SYSTEM</em> reservation. It
blocks access to all jobs because it possesses an empty access control
list. It is often useful when performing administrative tasks but cannot
be used for enforcing resource usage policies.</p>
<p>Administrative reservations are created and modified using the
<a class="reference external" href="commands/setres.html">setres</a> command. With this command, all
aspects of reservation timeframe, resource selection, and access control
can be dynamically updated.</p>
