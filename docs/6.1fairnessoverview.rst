Fairness Overview
#################

The concept of *fairness* varies widely from person to person and site
to site. To some it implies giving all users equal access to compute
resources. However, more complicated concepts incorporating historical
resource usage, political issues, and job *value* are equally valid.
While no scheduler can handle all possible definitions of what *fair*
means, Maui provides some flexible tools that help with most common
fairness management definitions and needs. Particularly, fairness
under Maui may be addressed by any combination of the facilities
described in the table below.
