Job Prioritization
##################

In general, prioritization is the process of determining which of many
options best fulfills overall goals. In the case of scheduling, a site
will often have multiple, independent goals which may include maximizing
system utilization, giving preference to users in specific projects, or
making certain that no job sits in the queue for more than a given
period of time. The approach used by Maui in representing a
multi-faceted set of site goals is to assign weights to the various
objectives so an overall value or priority can be associated with each
potential scheduling decision. With the jobs prioritized, the scheduler
can roughly fulfill site objectives by starting the jobs in priority
order.
