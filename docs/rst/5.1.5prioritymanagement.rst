Manual Job Priority Adjustment
##############################

Batch administrator's regularly find a need to adjust the calculated
priority of a job to meet current needs. Current needs often are broken
into two categories:

| A) The need to run an admin test job as soon as possible
| B) The need to pacify an irate user

Under Maui, the `setspri <commands/setspri.html>`__ command can be used
to handle these issues in one of two ways. This command allows the
specification of either a relative priority adjustment, or the
specification of a absolute priority. Using absolute priority
specification, administrators can set a job priority which is guaranteed
to be higher than any calculated value. Where Maui-calculated job
priorities are in the range of 0 to 1 billion, system admin assigned
absolute priorities start at 1 billion and go up. Issuing the command
'setspri <PRIO> <JOBID>', for example, will assign a priority of '1
billion + <PRIO>' to the job. Thus, 'setspri 5 job.1294' with set the
priority of job 'job.1294' to 1000000005.
