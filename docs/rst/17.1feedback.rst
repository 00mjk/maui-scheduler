User Feedback Overview
######################

The 'Feedback' facility allows a site to provide job performance
information to users at job completion time. When a job completes, the
program pointed to by the
`FEEDBACKPROGRAM <a.fparameters.html#feedbackprogram>`__ parameter is
called with a number of command line arguments. The site is responsible
for creating a program capable of processing and acting upon the
contents of the command line. The command line arguments passed are a
follows

| - job name
| - user name
| - NONE
| - final job state
| - QOS requested
| - epoch time job was submitted
| - epoch time job started
| - epoch time job completed
| - job XFactor
| - job wallclock limit
| - processors requested
| - memory requested
| - average per task cpu load
| - maximum per task cpu load
| - average per task memory usage
| - maximum per task memory usage

For many sites, the feedback script is useful as a means of letting
user's know that accuracy of their wallclock limit estimate, as well as
the cpu efficiency, and memory usage pattern of their job. The feedback
script may be used as a mechanism to do any of the following:

| - email users regarding statistics of all completed jobs
| - email users only when certain criteria are met (ie. "Dear John, you
  submitted job X requesting 128MB of memory per task. It actually
  utilized 253 MB of memory per task potentially wreaking havoc with the
  entire system! Please improve your resource usage estimates in future
  jobs!")
| - update system databases
| - take system actions based on job completion statistics

.. note::

   some of these fields may be set to zero if the underlying
   OS/Resource Manager does not support the necessary data collection.
