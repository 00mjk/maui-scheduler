commands which can be helpful.

Checkjob will evaluate the ability of a job to start immediately. Tests
include resource access, node state, job constraints (ie, startdate,
taskspernode,QOS, etc). Additionally, command line flags may be
specified to provide further information.

| -l <POLICYLEVEL> // evaluate impact of throttling policies on job

| -n <NODENAME> // evaluate resource access on specific node
| -r <RESERVATION\_LIST> // evaluate access to specified reservations
