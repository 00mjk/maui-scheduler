Appendix B: Extension Interface
###############################

Maui supports an extension interface which allows external libraries to
be linked to the Maui server. This interface provides these libraries
with full access to and control over all Maui objects and data. It also
allows this library the ability to use or override most major Maui
functions.

The purpose of this library is to allow the development and use of
extension modules, or plug-ins, similar to those available for web
browsers.
