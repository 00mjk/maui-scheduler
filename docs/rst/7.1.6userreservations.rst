.. rubric:: 7.1.6 Enabling Reservations for End Users
   :name: enabling-reservations-for-end-users

By default, the power of advance reservations is only available to
scheduler administrators. While admins may create and manage
reservations to provide resource access to end users, end users cannot
create, modify, or destroy these reservations. Maui 3.2 extends the
ability to manage reservations to end users and provides control
facilities to keep this feature manageable.

.. rubric:: 7.1.6.1 Enabling User Reservation Management
   :name: enabling-user-reservation-management

The parameter **RESCTLPOLICY** controls who is allowed to administer
reservations using the **mresctl**, **setres**, and **releaseres**
commands. Valid settings are **ADMINONLY** and **ANY** which, as would
be expected, allows only scheduler administrators or any valid user to
manage reservations respectively. While scheduler administrators are
allowed to manage any reservation, users are only allowed to manage
their own reservations. This parameter defaults to **ADMINONLY**.

To allow general batch users to create and manage their own
reservations, the following parameter must be specified in the maui.cfg
file:

| ----
| ``RESCTLPOLICY  ANY``
| ----

.. rubric:: 7.1.6.2 Reservation Accountability
   :name: reservation-accountability

Reservations can be optionally configured with a set of *accountable*
credentials. These credentials indicate the user, group, account, etc
which is responsible for the resources dedicated by the reservation. If
resources are dedicated by a reservation but not consumed by a job,
these resources can be charged against the specified accountable
credentials. Administrators are allowed to create reservations and
specify the accountable credentials of that reservation. While end users
can also be allowed to create and otherwise modify an advance
reservation, they are not allowed to specify or modify the reservation's
accountable credentials. Anytime a user creates a reservation, the
credentials of the requestor are associated with the reservation.
Currently, this accountablility only applies to throttling policies and
allocation management system chargeability. Support for fairshare and
other forms of accountability will be incorporated over time.

.. rubric:: 7.1.6.3 Reservation Limits
   :name: reservation-limits

Allowing end users the ability to create advance reservations can lead
to potentially unfair and unproductive resource usage. This results from
the fact that by default, there is nothing to prevent a user from
reserving all resources in a given system or reserving resources during
time slots in such a way so to greatly impede the scheduler's ability to
schedule jobs efficiently. To address this, Maui provides the ability to
impose scheduler throttling policies onto reservations. With this
capability, a site may constrain the total amount of resources reserved
by any particular user, group, or account at any given time. This
facility tracks resources and enforces limits based on resources
dedicated to both jobs and user reservations.

Reservation limits are disabled by default but may be enabled by setting
the **RESLIMITPOLICY** parameter. This parameter specifies the level of
throttling policy to be be enforced. For example, to limit user
reservations by hard throttling policy limits, the following may be
specified:

| ----
| ``RESLIMITPOLICY  HARD``
| ----

While time spanning throttling policies are a significant step in the
direction of end user advance reservation management, it is important to
track actual site usage of the advance reservation facility. It is still
likely that further usage policies will be required at each site to
prevent reservation misuse and provide an optimally useful system.
