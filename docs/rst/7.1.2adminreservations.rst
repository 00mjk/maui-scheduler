Administrative Reservations
###########################

Administrative reservations behave much like standing reservations but
are generally created to address non-periodic, 'one time' issues. All
admin reservations are created using the
`setres <commands/setres.html>`__ command and are persistent until they
expire or are removed using the
`releaseres <commands/releaseres.html>`__ command.
