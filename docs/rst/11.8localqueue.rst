Using a Local Queue
###################

Maui allows jobs to be submitted directly to the scheduler. With the
*local queue*, the scheduler is able to directly manage the job or
*translate* it and resubmit it to a standard resource manager queue.
This capability allows sites to migrate resource managers without
re-training their users. Further, it allows the scheduler to dynamically
modify various job attributes in accordance with site scheduling
constraints and optimization policies.
